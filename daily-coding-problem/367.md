## Description

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

Given two sorted iterators, merge it into one iterator.

For example, given these two iterators:
```
foo = iter([5, 10, 15])
bar = iter([3, 8, 9])
```
You should be able to do:

```
for num in merge_iterators(foo, bar):
    print(num)

# 3
# 5
# 8
# 9
# 10
# 15
```

Bonus: Make it work without pulling in the contents of the iterators in memory.

## Kotlin Solution

TBD
