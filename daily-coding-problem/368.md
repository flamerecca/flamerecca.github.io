## Description

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement a key value store, where keys and values are integers, with the following methods:

- `update(key, vl)`: updates the value at key to val, or sets it if doesn't exist
- `get(key)`: returns the value with key, or None if no such value exists
- `max_key(val)`: returns the largest key with value val, or None if no key with that value exists

For example, if we ran the following calls:

```
kv.update(1, 1)
kv.update(2, 1)
```

And then called `kv.max_key(1)`, it should return `2`, since it's the largest key with value `1`.

## Kotlin Solution
