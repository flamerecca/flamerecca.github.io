Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given two binary numbers represented as strings, return the sum of the two binary numbers as a new binary represented as a string. Do this without converting the whole binary string into an integer.

Here's an example and some starter code.

def sum_binary(bin1, bin2):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(sum_binary("11101", "1011"))
# 101000
