Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:

Given 2 strings s and t, find and return all indexes in string s where t is an anagram.

Here's an example and some starter code:
```
def find_anagrams(s, t):
  # Fill this in.

print(find_anagrams('acdbacdacb', 'abc'))
# [3, 7]
```
