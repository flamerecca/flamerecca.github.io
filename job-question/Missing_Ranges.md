Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a sorted list of numbers, and two integers low and high representing the lower and upper bound of a range, return a list of (inclusive) ranges where the numbers are missing. A range should be represented by a tuple in the format of (lower, upper).

Here's an example and some starting code:
```
def missing_ranges(nums, low, high):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(missing_ranges([1, 3, 5, 10], 1, 10))
# [(2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 9)]
```
