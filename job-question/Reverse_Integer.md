Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given an integer, reverse the digits. Do not convert the integer into a string and reverse it.

Here's some examples and some starter code.

def reverse_integer(num):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(reverse_integer(135))
# 531

print(reverse_integer(-321))
# -123
