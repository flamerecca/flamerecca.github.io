Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given 2 binary trees t and s, find if s has an equal subtree in t, where the structure and the values are the same. Return True if it exists, otherwise return False.

Here's some starter code and an example:
```
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
    self.value = value
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

  def __repr__(self):
    return f"(Value: {self.value} Left: {self.left} Right: {self.right})"

def find_subtree(s, t):
  # Fill this in.

t3 = Node(4, Node(3), Node(2))
t2 = Node(5, Node(4), Node(-1))
t = Node(1, t2, t3)

s = Node(4, Node(3), Node(2))
"""
Tree t:
    1
   / \
  4   5 
 / \ / \
3  2 4 -1

Tree s:
  4 
 / \
3  2 
"""

print(find_subtree(s, t))
# True
```
