Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given a number n, generate all possible combinations of n well-formed brackets.

Here are some examples and some starting code.

def generate_brackets(n):
  #Fill this in.
  
print(generate_brackets(1))
# ['()']

print(generate_brackets(3))
# ['((()))', '(()())', '()(())', '()()()', '(())()']
