Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:

Given a binary tree, find the minimum depth of the binary tree. The minimum depth is the shortest distance from the root to a leaf.

Here's an example and some starter code.

class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
    self.value = value
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

def min_depth_bst(root):
  # Fill this in.
  
n3 = Node(3, None, Node(4))
n2 = Node(2, Node(3))
n1 = Node(1, n2, n3)

#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
#        \
#         4
print(min_depth_bst(n1))
# 2
