Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list of words, for each word find the shortest unique prefix. You can assume a word will not be a substring of another word (ie play and playing won't be in the same words list)

Example
```
Input: ['joma', 'john', 'jack', 'techlead']
Output: ['jom', 'joh', 'ja', 't']
```
Here's some starter code:
```
def shortest_unique_prefix(words):
  # Fill this in.

print(shortest_unique_prefix(['joma', 'john', 'jack', 'techlead']))
# ['jom', 'joh', 'ja', 't']
```
