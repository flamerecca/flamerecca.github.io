Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given a list of strings, find the list of characters that appear in all strings.

Here's an example and some starter code:

def common_characters(strs):
  # Fill this in.

print(common_characters(['google', 'facebook', 'youtube']))
# ['e', 'o']
