Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a list of points and a number k, find the k closest points to the origin.

def findClosestPointsOrigin(points, k):
  # Fill this in.

print (findClosestPointsOrigin([[1, 1], [3, 3], [2, 2], [4, 4], [-1, -1]], 3))
# [[-1, -1], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
