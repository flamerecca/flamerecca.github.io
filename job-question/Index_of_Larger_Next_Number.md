Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a list of numbers, for each element find the next element that is larger than the current element. Return the answer as a list of indices. If there are no elements larger than the current element, then use -1 instead.

Here's an example and some starter code:
```
def larger_number(nums):
  # Fill this in.
  
# print [2, 2, 3, 4, -1, -1]
print(larger_number([3, 2, 5, 6, 9, 8]))
```
