Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given a 2d n x m matrix where each cell has a certain amount of change on the floor, your goal is to start from the top left corner mat[0][0] and end in the bottom right corner mat[n - 1][m - 1] with the most amount of change. You can only move either left or down.

Here's some starter code:
```
def max_change(mat):
  # Fill this in.

mat = [
    [0, 3, 0, 2],
    [1, 2, 3, 3],
    [6, 0, 3, 2]
]

print(max_change(mat))
# 13
```
