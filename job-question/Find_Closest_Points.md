Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:

Given a list of points as a tuple (x, y) and an integer k, find the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

Here's an example and some starter code:
```
def closest_points(points, k):
  # Fill this in.

print(closest_points([(0, 0), (1, 2), (-3, 4), (3, 1)], 2))
# [(1, 2), (0, 0)]
```
