Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

Given a list of sorted numbers (can be both negative or positive), return the list of numbers squared in sorted order.

Here's an example and some starting code:
```
def square_numbers(nums):
 # Fill this in.

print(square_numbers([-5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 4, 5]))
# [0, 1, 1, 9, 16, 25, 25]
```
