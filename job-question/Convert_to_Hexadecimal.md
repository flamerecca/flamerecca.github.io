Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given a non-negative integer n, convert the integer to hexadecimal and return the result as a string. Hexadecimal is a base 16 representation of a number, where the digits are 0123456789ABCDEF. Do not use any builtin base conversion functions like hex.

Here's an example and some starter code.

def to_hex(n):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(to_hex(123))
# 7B
