Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

A fixed point in a list is where the value is equal to its index. So for example the list [-5, 1, 3, 4], 1 is a fixed point in the list since the index and value is the same. Find a fixed point (there can be many, just return 1) in a sorted list of distinct elements, or return None if it doesn't exist.

Here is a starting point:
```
def find_fixed_point(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print find_fixed_point([-5, 1, 3, 4])
# 1
```
Can you do this in sublinear time?
