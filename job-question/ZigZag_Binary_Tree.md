Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given a binary tree, return the list of node values in zigzag order traversal. Here's an example
```
# Input:
#         1
#       /   \
#      2     3
#     / \   / \
#    4   5 6   7
#
# Output: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
Here's some starter code
```
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
    self.value = value
    self.left = left
    self.right = right

def zigzag_order(tree):
  # Fill this in.

n4 = Node(4)
n5 = Node(5)
n6 = Node(6)
n7 = Node(7)
n2 = Node(2, n4, n5)
n3 = Node(3, n6, n7)
n1 = Node(1, n2, n3)

print(zigzag_order(n1))
# [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
