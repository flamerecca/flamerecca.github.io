Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given an array of numbers, determine whether it can be partitioned into 3 arrays of equal sums.

For instance,
[0, 2, 1, -6, 6, -7, 9, 1, 2, 0, 1] can be partitioned into:
[0, 2, 1], [-6, 6, -7, 9, 1], [2, 0, 1] all of which sum to 3.

class Solution(object):
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, A):
      # Fill this in.0

print(Solution().canThreePartsEqualSum(
    [0, 2, 1, -6, 6, -7, 9, 1, 2, 0, 1]))
# True
