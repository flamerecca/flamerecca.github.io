Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a string, determine if you can remove any character to create a palindrome.

Here's some examples and some starter code:
```
def create_palindrome(s):
  # Fill this in.

print(create_palindrome("abcdcbea"))
# True
print(create_palindrome("abccba"))
# False
print(create_palindrome("abccaa"))
# False
```
