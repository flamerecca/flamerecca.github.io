Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

You are given an array of integers, and an integer K. Return the subarray which sums to K. You can assume that a solution will always exist.

def find_continuous_k(list, k):
  # Fill this in.

print find_continuous_k([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2], 14)
# [2, 5, 7]

Can you do this in linear time?
