Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list of unique numbers, generate all possible subsets without duplicates. This includes the empty set as well.

Here's an example and some starter code.
```
def generateAllSubsets(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print(generateAllSubsets([1, 2, 3]))
# [[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1], [1, 3], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
```
