Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:

Given an integer, check if that integer is a palindrome. For this problem do not convert the integer to a string to check if it is a palindrome.
```
import math

def is_palindrome(n):
  # Fill this in.

print is_palindrome(1234321)
# True
print is_palindrome(1234322)
# False
```
