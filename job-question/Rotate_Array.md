Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given an array and an integer k, rotate the array by k spaces. Do this without generating a new array and without using extra space.

Here's an example and some starter code
```
def rotate_list(nums, k):
  # Fill this in.

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rotate_list(a, 2)
print(a)
# [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```
