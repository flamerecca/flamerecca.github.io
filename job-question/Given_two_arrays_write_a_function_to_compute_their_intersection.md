Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection - the intersection means the numbers that are in both arrays.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
```
Note:
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.

Here's a starting point:
```
class Solution:
  def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
    # Fill this in.

print Solution().intersection([4, 9, 5], [9, 4, 9, 8, 4])
# [9, 4]
```
