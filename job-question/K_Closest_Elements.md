Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:

Given a list of sorted numbers, and two integers k and x, find k closest numbers to the pivot x.

Here's an example and some starter code:
```
def closest_nums(nums, k, x):
 # Fill this in.
 
print(closest_nums([1, 3, 7, 8, 9], 3, 5))
# [7, 3, 8]
```
