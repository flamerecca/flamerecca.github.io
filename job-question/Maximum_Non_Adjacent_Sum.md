Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

Given a list of positive numbers, find the largest possible set such that no elements are adjacent numbers of each other.

Here's some example and some starter code
```
def maxNonAdjacentSum(nums):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(maxNonAdjacentSum([3, 4, 1, 1]))
# 5
# max sum is 4 (index 1) + 1 (index 3)

print(maxNonAdjacentSum([2, 1, 2, 7, 3]))
# 9
# max sum is 2 (index 0) + 7 (index 3)
```
