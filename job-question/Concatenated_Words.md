Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:

Find all words that are concatenations of a list.

Input:
["tech", "lead", "techlead", "cat", "cats", "dog", "catsdog"]

Output:
['techlead', 'catsdog']

class Solution(object):
  def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words):
    # Fill this in.
    
input = ["tech", "lead", "techlead", "cat", "cats", "dog", "catsdog"]

print(Solution().findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(input))

Note: This question is classified as "hard."
HINT: Start with a brute-force solution.
