Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:

Pascal's Triangle is a triangle where all numbers are the sum of the two numbers above it. Here's an example of the Pascal's Triangle of size 5.
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
Given an integer n, generate the n-th row of the Pascal's Triangle.

Here's an example and some starter code.

def pascal_triangle_row(n):
  # Fill this in.

print(pascal_triangle_row(6))
# [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
