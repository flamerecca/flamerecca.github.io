Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

A Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself.

For instance,
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

Write a function to determine if a number is a perfect number.

class Solution(object):
  def checkPerfectNumber(self, num):
    # Fill this in.

print(Solution().checkPerfectNumber(28))
# True
# 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
