Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list, find the k-th largest element in the list.
```
Input: list = [3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8], k = 3
Output: 5
```
Here is a starting point:
```
def findKthLargest(nums, k):
  # Fill this in.

print findKthLargest([3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8], 3)
# 5
```
