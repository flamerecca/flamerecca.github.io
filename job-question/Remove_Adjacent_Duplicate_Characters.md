Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given a string, we want to remove 2 adjacent characters that are the same, and repeat the process with the new string until we can no longer perform the operation.

Here's an example and some starter code:

def remove_adjacent_dup(s):
  # Fill this in.

print(remove_adjacent_dup("cabba"))
# Start with cabba
# After remove bb: caa
# After remove aa: c
# print c
