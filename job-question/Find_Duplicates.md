Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

Given an array of size n, and all values in the array are in the range 1 to n, find all the duplicates.

class Solution(object):
  def findDuplicates(self, nums):
    # Fill this in.

print(Solution().findDuplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))
# [2, 3]
