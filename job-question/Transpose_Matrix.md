Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:

Given a matrix, transpose it. Transposing a matrix means the rows are now the column and vice-versa.

Here's an example:
```
def transpose(mat):
  # Fill this in.

mat = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
]

print(transpose(mat))
# [[1, 4],
#  [2, 5], 
#  [3, 6]]
```
