Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

N-Queens is the problem where you find a way to put n queens on a nxn chess board without them being able to attack each other. Given an integer n, return 1 possible solution by returning all the queen's position.

Here's an example and some starter code:

def n_queens(n):
  # Fill this in.

print(n_queens(5))
# There can be many answers
# [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 3)]

# Q . . . .
