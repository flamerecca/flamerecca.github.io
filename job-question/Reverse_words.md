Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given a list of words in a string, reverse the words in-place (ie don't create a new string and reverse the words). Since python strings are not mutable, you can assume the input will be a mutable sequence (like list).

Here's an example and some starting code:
```
def reverse_words(words):
  # Fill this in.

s = list("can you read this")
reverse_words(s)
print(''.join(s))
# this read you can
```
