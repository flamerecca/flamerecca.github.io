Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree in the form of arrays. Write a function that reconstructs the tree represented by these traversals.

Example:
Preorder: [a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
Inorder: [d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

The tree that should be constructed from these traversals is:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g

Here's a start:

from collections import deque

class Node(object):
  def __init__(self, val):
    self.val = val
    self.left = None
    self.right = None

  def __str__(self):
    q = deque()
    q.append(self)
    result = ''
    while len(q):
      n = q.popleft()
      result += n.val
      if n.left:
        q.append(n.left)
      if n.right:
        q.append(n.right)

    return result


def reconstruct(preorder, inorder):
  # Fill this in.

tree = reconstruct(['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'f', 'g'],
                   ['d', 'b', 'e', 'a', 'f', 'c', 'g'])
print tree
# abcdefg
