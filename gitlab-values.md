# CREDIT

GitLab 的六個價值是合作（Collaboration），結果（Results），效率（Efficiency），多元（Diversity），迭代（Iteration）和透明（Transparency）。這六個字拼成 CREDIT 作為我們送給各位的禮物。這些價值觀是相互關聯的，彼此之間互相合作以保護我們公司的文化。下面逐一解釋這些價值觀的操作方式：

## Collaboration

即使對目標沒有立即性的幫助，幫助別人應該是首要項目。相同的，你可以依靠別人的協助與意見 - 事實上你也應該要這樣。
每個人，包含不在 gitlab 公司工作的人，都可以對任何專案提意見。對專案負責的人決定專案要怎麼做，但是他應該要認真看待其他人的意見，並解釋為什麼之前有或者沒有這麼做。

1. **和藹** 我們很重視互相照顧這件事。互相關心協助建立一個能直接互相挑戰與提供回饋環境。我們不同意有的公司說的 [精準的評估別人，而不是「和藹的」](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt). 我們支持精準的評估，但是這必須要以親切的方式進行。盡可能公開的給予彼此正向的回應。
1. **分享** GitLab 有一些文化，比方說極度的透明化，對其他人或者新進員工來說是很不直覺的。要努力在其他人身上花時間，並參與公開的對話。舉例來說，可以盡量將私下的議題公開討論，所以其他人都能從這些議題的經驗中學習。
1. **負面訊息要一對一** 越少人看到負面訊息越好。建議可以用一對一的視訊。
1. **說謝謝** 公開對幫助過你的人道謝，比方說在我們的 [#thanks chat channel](/handbook/communication/#internal-communication) 裡面。
1. **有效地給予回饋** 給予回饋是很難的，但是有效地給予回饋非常重要。給予回饋時，要注意對事不對人，針對事情本身的影響而不要針對人本身。 提供意見時注意至少要給一個近期明確的例子。If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account. An example of giving positive feedback is our [thanks chat channel](/handbook/communication/#internal-communication). For managers, it's important to realize that employees react to a negative incident with their managers [六倍](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee) than they do to a positive one. Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself. In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the employee’s performance going forward. Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to [generate more engagement](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=LOW14298USEN) from your team.
1. **認識彼此** 現在我們使用大量的文字溝通，一旦你認識文字背後的人，就比較容易避免衝突。鼓勵同事們互相彼此認識，像是透過 [company calls](/handbook/communication/#company-call)，[virtual coffee breaks](/culture/remote-only/#coffee-break-calls)，以及透過[高峰會](/culture/summits/).
1. **不要拿階級說話** 如果你必須提醒某人你在公司的職位，那一定有哪邊出錯了。大家已經知道我們的決策過程。解釋你做出決定的原因，並且無論對方在公司的職位如何，尊重每個人的看法。
1. **標記行為，但不貼標籤**  [這篇文章](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html) 裡面提到很多不讓怪人（jerk）加入團隊的好處，但我們相信**怪人**是針對行為的標籤，而不是針對人的。我們要避免對人的分類。
1. **說對不起** 一旦犯錯就道歉。說對不起並不是示弱的象徵，恰好相反，是一種力量的象徵。當一個人做越多事情，那麼就可能犯下更多錯誤。另外，當我們分享我們犯下的錯並讓大家注意到這些錯誤，其他人就可以從這些錯誤中學習，也就可以避免其他人也犯下相同的錯誤。
1. **不要自我膨脹** 不要為了贏得爭論去捍衛觀點或者重複錯誤。你本人的和你正在做的事情是不同的。你不需要去捍衛你的觀點。但是你需要其他人的幫助來找出正確答案。
1. **看見他人的成功** 一個和 GitLab 裡面很多人談過的候選人提到，與其他的公司相比，這間公司有個地方特別突出：這裡每個人都提到希望能看見其他人成功。
1. **People are not their work** Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person. Say, "you didn't respond to my feedback about the design," instead of, "you never listen". And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve and that others want to see you succeed.
1. **Do it yourself** Our collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help. No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or [do with two what you can do yourself](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html).
1. **Blameless problem solving** Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless [post-mortems](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) and [retrospectives](handbook/engineering/management/team-retrospectives/) for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.
1. **Dogfooding** We [use our own product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Our development organization uses GitLab.com to manage the DevOps lifecycle of the GitLab CE and EE projects. Our entire company uses GitLab to collaborate on this handbook. We also capture other content and processes in Git repos and manage them with GitLab.

## 結果

We do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors.

1. **Measure results not hours** We care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon
off shouldn't feel like they did something wrong. You don't have to defend how you spend your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too long hours talk to your manager to discuss solutions.
1. **Write promises down** Agree in writing on measurable goals. Within the company we use [public OKRs](/okrs/) for that.
1. **Growth mindset** You don't always get results and this will result in criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. We try to hire people based on [their trajectory, not their pedigree](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).
1. **Global optimization** This name comes from the [quick guide to Stripe's culture](https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info?a=1#culture). Our definition of global optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don't optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. Keep your team as lean as possible, and help other teams achieve their goals.
1. **Tenacity** We refer to this as "persistence of purpose". As talked about in [The Influence Blog](https://www.learntoinfluence.com/developing-tenacity-when-facing-opposition/) tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more.
1. **Ownership** We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. Having a task means you are responsible for anticipating and solving problems. As an owner you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers, or other team members. Take initiative and pro-actively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.
1. **Sense of urgency** At an exponentially scaling startup time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.
1. **Ambitious** While we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results.
1. **Bias for Action** It's important that we keep our focus on action, and don't fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly.

## 效率

We care about working on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work. This enables us to achieve more progress, which makes our work more fulfilling.

1. **Boring solutions** Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that [“boring” should not be conflated with “bad.“](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a stabler and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.
1. **Efficiency for the right group** Optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community.  Making a process efficient for one person or a small group may not be the efficient outcome for the whole GitLab community.  As an example, it may be best to choose a process making things slightly less efficient for you while making things massively more efficient for thousands of customers.  For example: choose to replace a renewal process that requires 1,000s of customers to spend 2 hours each with one that only takes 60 seconds even when it may make a monthly report less efficient internally! In a decision, ask yourself "for whom does this need to be most efficient?"  Quite often, the answer may be your users, contributors, customers, or team members that are dependent upon your decision.
1. **Be respectful of others' time** Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.
1. **Spend company money like it's your own** Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back; be as frugal with company money as you are with your own.
1. **Frugality** [Amazon states it best](http://www.amazon.jobs/principles) with: "Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.".
1. **ConvDev** We work according to the principles of [conversational development](http://conversationaldevelopment.com/).
1. **Freedom** You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit.
1. **Short verbal answers** Give short answers to verbal questions so the other party has the opportunity to ask more or move on.
1. **Keep broadcasts short** And keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in [this HBR study](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity): "A majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it’s too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.".
1. **Managers of one** We want team members to be [a manager of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one) who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.
1. **Responsibility over rigidity** When possible we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that instead of imposing rules and approval processes.
1. **Accept mistakes** Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient, a mistake only affects one.
1. **Move fast by shipping the minimum viable change** We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is too big to deliver in one month, cut scope.

## 多元

The community consists of people from all over the world, with different backgrounds and opinions. We hire globally and encourage hiring in a diverse set of countries. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and nationalities in our community and company. For example our sponsorship of [diversity events](/2016/03/24/sponsorship-update/) and a [double referral bonus](/handbook/incentives/#referral-bonuses).

1. **Culture fit is a bad excuse** We don't hire based on culture or select candidates because we'd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward employees based on our shared values as detailed on this page. If they are measured against our shared values, they will already be a fit.
We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity, for example, a [brogrammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer) atmosphere. Said differently: ["culture add" > "culture fit"](https://twitter.com/Una/status/846808949672366080) or "hire for culture contribution" since our [mission is everyone can contribute](/strategy/#mission).
1. **Don't bring religion or politics to work** We don't discuss religion or politics because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. Feel free to mention you attended a ceremony or rally, but don't mention the religion or party.
1. **Quirkiness**: Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting.
Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. An example
is our [company call](/handbook/communication/#company-call) where we spend most of our time talking about what we did in our private lives, from fire-throwing to
knitting. Open source is a great way to interact with interesting
people. We try to hire people who think work is a great way to express themselves.
1. **Building a safe community**  Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for GitLab and/or being a part of the GitLab community contributing to our community.  We do not tolerate abuse, [harassment](/handbook/anti-harassment/), exclusion, discrimination or retaliation by/of any community members, including our employees.
1. **Unconscious bias**.  We are responsible not only for what we intend to say but also for the effect it creates.  This includes not only obvious disrespect or lack inclusion but also the everyday things - well-intentioned people nevertheless unintentionally injuring one another due to ignorance.  That means we [all need to get better](/culture/inclusion/) at recognizing unconscious or implicit bias in ourselves.
1. **Inclusion** Rather than focusing on building diversity as a collection of activities, data, and metrics, we're choosing to [build and institutionalize](http://www.russellreynolds.com/en/Insights/thought-leadership/Documents/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20GameChangers%20FINAL.PDF) a culture that is [inclusive](/culture/inclusion/) and supports all employees equally to achieve their professional goals. We will refer to this intentional culture curation as inclusion and development (i & d).
1. **Inclusive benefits** We list our [Transgender Medical Services](/handbook/benefits/inc-benefits-us/#transgender-medical-services) and [Parental Leave](/handbook/benefits/#parental-leave) publicly so people don't have to ask for them during interviews.
1. **Inclusive language** In our [general guidelines](/handbook/general-guidelines/) we list: 'Use inclusive language. For example, prefer "Hi everybody" or "Hi people" to "Hi guys".'
1. **Inclusive interviewing** As part of our [interviewing process](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/) we list: "The candidate should be interviewed by at least one female GitLab team member."
1. **See Something, Say Something**  As a global distributed company, we have employees from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means that it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes make a mistake. It is important that our teammates let us know when we have a made a mistake so we can learn from that mistake and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don't feel excluded or minimized but the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn't respectful or inclusive. If somebody says something stupid, tell them and help them understand why.
1. **Neurodiversity** [Neurodiversity](http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/neurodiversity-some-basic-terms-definitions/) is a type of diversity that includes Autism, ADHD, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While they often bring [unique skills and abilities](https://adhdatwork.add.org/potential-benefits-of-having-an-adhd-employee/), which can be harnessed for [competitive advantage](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against, and sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. These individuals should be able to contribute as GitLabbers. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing process should never discriminate against the neurodivergent.

## 迭代

我們做[盡可能小的事情，並且盡可能快推出](/2017/01/04/behind-the-scenes-how-we-built-review-apps/)。如果你有個提案在第一次迭代中可以排除在外，並且可以變成單獨的 Issue ，則不要寫成一個巨大的提案，只要寫第一步即可。相信你在東西推出之後，會更知道如何進行下一步。如果你在第一次迭代中，覺得你推出的功能太小因而感到羞恥，那你就做對了。這個價值是人們剛加入 GitLab 時最常低估的，你工作過程和產出的影響力會比你原先預期的大。快速做決策，並看事情在很少討論之下改變，在一開始會感到十分痛苦。但頻繁推出最簡單的版本，最終結果會是最好的。

加入 GitLab 的人們都會說他們已經在實踐這樣的迭代方式，但這個價值是所有價值中最難採納的。人們已訓練成如果事情沒十全十美交付，就會被盯。如果你有件事情做了一點點，之後還要繼續做。做完整件事情似乎更有效率（即使實際上並沒有）。如果成品的遠景還不明確，人們對你成品的理解，可能不會是你想要成品被理解的樣子。因此似乎做個包山包海的成品比較好。他們會覺得 GitLab 組織的其他人在迭代很有效率，但不知道怎麼做轉移。

要解決這樣的問題，必須寫下來「現在你給這個專案的時間，你只能做些什麼」。這個時間可能是 5 分鐘或 2 小時。想想你在那段時間能做些什麼，來改善現狀。迭代感覺起來不舒服，而且人們可能會問為什麼某某東西不完美。在這樣的情況下，解釋那是迭代，你只花了 x 部分的時間在那上面，在下個迭代會包含 y 而且在 z 會完成。

1. **減少週期** 短的迭代減少[我們的週期](/features/cycle-analytics/)
1. **和社群一起工作** 小的迭代促進與更廣泛的社群協作。他們的工作會看起來更像我們的工作，而且我們的工作也會更快給出回饋。
1. **最小可行更新 Minimum Viable Change (MVC)** 永遠找尋更快可能的改變來改善成果。如果你覺得做某事會比現況更好，就做。不需要等某事更完美一些再做。[更多的資訊在產品手冊有提到](/handbook/product/#the-minimally-viable-change)，但這個原則在我們所有部門都適用。
1. **寫下提案** 如果你需要團隊決定某事，與其召開會議，不如直接寫下提案，來得到所有人的意見。有個提案會更有效地使用所有人的時間。如果最後是實作完全不一樣的提案，收到提案的人不該覺得被排擠，提出提案的人也不該覺得難過。別讓你的自我，或是想要看見自己的解決方案被實現的心情，阻礙產出最佳成果。
1. **每件事都是草稿** 在 Gitlab 的任何內容或提案很少有草稿。每件事都是草稿，而且隨時都有可能改變。
1. **施工中** 當我們得到更多使用者時，他們會要求穩定性，特別是針對使用者體驗。我們應該永遠對長遠做優化。這代表我們的使用者在短期會感受到不方便，但現在和未來的使用者最終會享有更好的產品。
1. **低度羞恥感** Nat Friedman 曾和我們說：「保有低度羞恥感是你們文化的一部分」。我們東西未達心中期望就推出，心中的痛苦感被這句話準確表達出來。
1. **做那些不會規模化的事情** 優先優化速度與產出，產出成功再來講究如何規模化。 [Paul Graham 的文章](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) 有良好範例。
1. **不要為了雙向門等待** 大多數的決策都是可逆的，讓[直接負責人（Directly Responsible Individual）](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/directly-responsible-individuals/) 不須核准就去做決策。如 [Jeff Bezos 所說](http://minimumviablestrategy.com/lessons/leadership/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/)，只有不可逆的決策，才需要決策流程。

## 透明

Be open about as many things as possible. By making information
public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.
An example is the [public repository of this website](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/)
that also contains this [company handbook](/handbook/). Everything we do is public by default, for example, the [GitLab CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues) and [GitLab EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues) issue trackers, but also [marketing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues) and [infrastructure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues). Transparency creates awareness for GitLab, allows us to recruit people that care about our culture, it gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons,
and processes with the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.
There are exceptions though. Material that is not public by default is documented in the [general guidelines](/handbook/general-guidelines). On a personal level, you should tell it like it is instead of putting up a poker face. Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake or were wrong. When something went wrong it is a great opportunity to say "What’s the [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) moment here?" and find a better way without hurt feelings.

1. **Public by default** Everything at GitLab is public by default.
1. **Directness** is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner Ben Horowitz by being [both straightforward
and kind, an uncommon cocktail of no-bullshit and no-asshole](https://medium.com/@producthunt/ben-horowitz-s-best-startup-advice-7e8c09c8de1b). Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn't mean it will be easy to give nor receive it.
1. **Surface issues constructively** Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable)
1. **Anyone and anything can be questioned** Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed.
1. **Disagree and commit** Everything can be questioned but as long as a decision is in place we expect people to commit to executing it, which is [a common principle](http://ryanestis.com/leadership/disagree-and-commit-to-get-things-done/).
1. **Transparency is only a value if you do it when it is hard**. For example, many companies in California do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we'll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought. Another example is being transparent about [security incidents](http://disq.us/p/1r9gceh).

# 五種功能障礙

Our values help us to prevent the [五種功能障礙](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary).

1. **Absence of trust** Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => _prevented by collaboration, specifically kindness_
1. **避免衝突** Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => _prevented by transparency, specifically directness_
1. **缺乏信賴** 假裝支持團體的承諾，會在整個集團之中創造分歧 buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization => _prevented by transparency, specifically directness_
1. **Avoidance of accountability** Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => _prevented by results, iteration, and transparency_
1. **Inattention to results** Focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success => _prevented by results_

Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values, for example trust is not one of our values.
Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly.
We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.

# Why have values

Our values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable.
They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire.
They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others.
Values are a framework for distributed decision making, they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.

# Hierarchy

Occasionally, values can contradict each other. For instance, transparency would dictate we publish all security vulnerabilities the moment they are found, but this would jeopardize our users. It's useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values.

# Updating our values

Our values are updated continually when needed. Everyone is welcome to make a suggestion to improve them. To update: make a merge request and assign it to the CEO. If you're a [team member](/team/) or in the [core team](/core-team/) please post a link to the MR in the #values channel. If you're not part of those groups please send a direct Twitter message to [@sytses](https://twitter.com/sytses).

# How do we reinforce our values

Whatever behavior you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values through the following actions:

1. By what we do, especially what the leadership does.
1. By what we select for during hiring.
1. By what we emphasize during on-boarding.
1. By what criteria we use for promotions
1. By what criteria we use for bonuses.
1. By what behavior we compliment.
1. By what criteria we use to let people go.

# Permission to play

From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious, we call them our permission to play behavior:

- Be truthful and honest.
- Be dependable, reliable, fair, and respectful.
- Be committed, creative, inspiring, and passionate.
- Be deserving of the trust of our users and customers.
- Act in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.
- Act in accordance with the law.

# Question from new team members

During every [GitLab 101 session with new hires](/culture/gitlab-101/) we discuss our values. We document the questions and answers to [Frequently Asked Questions about the GitLab Culture](/culture/gitlab-101/#frequently-asked-questions-about-the-gitlab-culture).

# Mission

Our [mission](/strategy/#mission) guides our path, during this path live our values.
